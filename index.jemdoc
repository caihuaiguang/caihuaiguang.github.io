== Research Interests
My research aims to develop *reliable*, *explainable*, and *practical* decision-making algorithms. I am also interested in methods with elegant mathematical modeling.
Currently, my focus is on enhancing the *reasoning capabilities* of large language models.
- Algorithms (Algorithmic Game Theory, Online Learning Theory, Ad Auction)
- Machine Learning (Explainable AI, Edge computing, Recommendation system)
- Large Language Models (Long Context, Enhanced Reasoning, Efficient Training)

*Learning in games, last-iterate, Blackwell approachability theorem*
[https://github.com/caihuaiguang/PIDCFR/blob/main/pic/full.pdf \[Results\]]\n
Experimentally observed that predictive CFR algorithms converge much faster in last-iterate than in average-iterate in non-HUNL two-player zero-sum games.
I am now working on connecting the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) algorithm in control theory with the Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm in game theory by developing a last-iterate version of the Blackwell approachability theorem.\n



== Education Background


I am a master's student majoring in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems at [http://english.ia.cas.cn/ Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)], [https://english.ucas.ac.cn/  University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)], advised by [https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~wenshengzhang Prof. Wensheng Zhang].

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/  School of Computer Science and Engineering], [https://www.sysu.edu.cn/ Sun Yat-Sen (Zhongshan) University], advised fortunately by [https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/ZhouZhi Prof. Zhi Zhou] and [https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/WangChangdong Prof. Chang-Dong Wang].
